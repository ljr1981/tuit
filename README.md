Let's Get Tuit

## Introduction Tuit
In Eiffel, we can include some or all contract assertions in our final production binaries. The result of a broken contract is a broken program. It just stops, dumps a callstack, and exits. But what if we wanted to silently fail—sending messages, emails, or logging instead of just abject failure? In this case—we want to know about a contract failure, but we do not want it breaking our production application! Viola—let's do it with Tuit!
